    <h5 id="YOUR_ACCEPTANCE_OF">YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS</h5>
    <p>These Terms of Service (the &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) governs your use of Kala. By enrolling in Kala, you are consenting, without condition, to act in accordance and be bound by the Agreement, as well as our Privacy and Data Use Policy found at
      <a href="/privacy">http://www.mykala.com/privacy</a> (&ldquo;Privacy Policy&rdquo;). Your continued use of Kala shall also constitute assent to the terms set forth in this Agreement. If you do not wish to comply with our terms and conditions, please do not accept this Agreement and do not use the Kala services.</p>
    <p>We will periodically update the Agreement to reflect our current practices and policies.&nbsp; We will notify you via email, text or other notice on Kala of any material changes to this policy before those changes become effective.</p>
    <h5 id="DEFINITIONS_TERMS">DEFINITIONS &amp; TERMS</h5>
    <p>&ldquo;Data&rdquo; means all of your registration information and other data and information collected, processed and retained by Kala.&nbsp; For more information on the Data we collect, please review our Privacy and Data Use Policy.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Kala&rdquo; means the Kala Online Retail Marketplace program owned and provided by Triliant, LLC and accessed by you under this agreement via the MyKala.com website, the Kala mobile application, and other access points.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Systems&rdquo; means mobile devices, computers, software, network and communications equipment and ancillary services that are owned, controlled or procured by you.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Vendors&rdquo; means, collectively, third parties that perform business operations on behalf of Kala, such as transaction processing, billing, mailing, communications services (e-mail, direct mail, etc.), marketing, data processing and analytics, servicing, collections, or ad management.</p>
    <p>"Business Partners" means, collectively, the retailers, merchants, service organizations, consumer goods companies, and other third party businesses enrolled in or employed by Kala to perform services on our behalf. Examples include 3
      <sup>rd</sup> party sellers who list products and fulfill orders, as well as service organizations used to process payments, track your order shipments, provide customer service support, and send messages and communications such as email.</p>

    <h5 id="YOUR_KALA_ACCOUNT">YOUR KALA ACCOUNT</h5>
    <p>You will need to create an account in order to use Kala&rsquo;s full services. Let&rsquo;s go over a few ground rules with respect to your account.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Be an adult </strong>&ndash; you must be 18 or older to use Kala and our Services. If you are 15 years of age or older, you may elect to use our Services, provided that they are used under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who manages your Kala account.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Be respectful</strong> &ndash; in posting content, reviews, and interacting with sellers and other users, be respectful not to use language or content that could be considered offensive, threatening, vulgar, obscene, or otherwise illegal. Members who are found to be in violation may have their content removed, or have their account suspended and/or terminated by Kala. You are representing that you have all necessary rights to any content posted from your account in Kala, and that you are not violating any third parties&rsquo; rights by using it.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Be honest</strong> &ndash; please provide accurate information about yourself when creating and using your account. Do not use false information or impersonate another user, person, or company through your account.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Be responsible</strong> &ndash; you are solely responsible for your own account, and for activity performed under your account. Kala accounts may not be transferred to another person or entity. Any fraudulent activity, including use of stolen credit cards, or other fraudulent payment methods, scams, or other illicit activity within your account will not be tolerated.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Protect your account </strong>&ndash; it&rsquo;s extremely important to keep your account and password secure. Please be sure to use a unique password that contains at least 8 characters, including a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols that is difficult for anyone else to guess.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>We&rsquo;re not in a relationship </strong>&ndash; the terms of this Agreement don&rsquo;t create any partnership, joint venture, employment, agency, or other relationship between yourself and Kala.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Grant Permission to your Content</strong> &ndash; by posting content within Kala, you are granting Kala a non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, and royalty free license to use, display, modify, store, distribute, and reproduce that content.. Kala does not claim any ownership rights to your content, but does have permission to use it for our business purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To give you a better understanding of why this is important, take the example of profile images and product reviews. Kala may need to reformat the profile image to properly fit within a page, or we may feature your reviews to allow other users to gain from your wisdom before making a purchase.</p>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Kala harmless from all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising out of any use or disclosure of your data or content permitted hereunder.</p>
    <h5 id="USE_OF_SERVICES">USE OF SERVICES</h5>
    <p>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use Kala and its services. Except for the limited rights and licenses expressly granted hereunder, no other license is granted to you, no other use is permitted and Kala (and its licensors) shall retain all right, title and interest in and to Kala, including all intellectual property and proprietary rights.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shipping charges, return policies, response to non-delivered products or stolen deliveries, and other terms of your purchases made through Kala vary for each retailer or brand (collectively referred to herein as &ldquo;Business Partners&rdquo;).</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Kala sells products from many Business Partners. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, each Business Partner establishes their own policies independently. You are responsible for reviewing and understanding the specific rules, terms, shipping and return policies, and other disclosures of each Business Partner.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Help us make Kala better by providing your ideas and suggestions on how to improve your user experience or make our services more enjoyable. Any ideas or materials you submit to us are considered non-proprietary and non-confidential, and you are granting us a non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, and royalty free license to use, build, and publish those ideas and materials without compensating you.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>You shall obtain and operate all Systems needed to use Kala, and ensure that all Systems are compatible with Kala.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 id="TERMINATION">TERMINATION</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Terminating your Account </strong>&ndash; while we never want to see you leave, you can terminate your account with Kala at any point by logging in and accessing your account settings. Termination will not necessarily affect the content you posted through Kala, and does not relieve you of any outstanding payments or bills you may have incurred.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Termination of your Account </strong>&ndash; Kala may terminate, suspend, or otherwise deactivate your account, and any accounts related to you, at any time and for any reason. Advanced notice is not required for Kala to terminate an account. In a case where your account is terminated or otherwise discontinued or deactivated, you have no legal right to continue use of Kala. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone, for any reason.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Survival </strong>&ndash; in the event of any termination, the terms of this Agreement shall remain in effect even after your access rights have been removed or revoked.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 id="CHANGES">CHANGES</h5>
    <p>We reserve the right to amend or update our Terms of Use on occasion. When this does happen, Kala will alert you via email, text or other notification on Kala of any material changes to this policy before those changes become effective. That way, you have the control to determine whether you wish to continue using our services. Your acceptance of the changes may be through your continued use of Kala after the changes become effective.</p>
